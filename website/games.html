				<h1 class = "htext">World War Wolves</h1>
	
				<p>World War Wolves is a fantasy war simulator based around the idea of canine husbandry. Inspired by titles such as the Fire Emblem series, Spore, and Battle Cats, WWW seeks a lighthearted but complex approach to the traditional war game genre with its pastel goth aesthetic and real genetic theory working behind the curtains.</p> 
				<p>Taking place in a future where wolves have become America's dominant species, the player is put in the role of general commander and tasked to dominate the world. The player proceeds to further their army with selective wolf breeding.</p>
				<p>WWW intends to be a realistic simulation of genetic progression, where the player's tactical action will be deeply rooted in their genetic choice for their army. As they progress in their conquest, they will be faced with problems such as recessive traits, gene pool diversity, genetic disorders and even inbreeding.
