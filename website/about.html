	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>Full Moon Studios originated as three college awkward college students who simply enjoyed gaming and wanted to create their own. Their first ingenious idea for a video game was a mystery romance werewolf visual novel, but somehow that awesome plan fell through. Nevertheless, Full Moon Studios continues chugging away whenever they have free time between classes.</p>
