		<p>Jack is a nocturnal Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. He is a designer, developer, and artist for Full Moon Studios, and can be described as something of a *jack* of all trades. He enjoyed learning programming as a child because it made him feel smarter than everyone else, and he wanted to become a game developer/artist/designer ever since he got hooked on the Dragon Age series. When he isn't busying away, Jack enjoys tea, baking, and taking naps with his cat, Lucian.</p>
