	<h1>Our Team</h1>

	<h2>Jack Shen</h1>

	<p>Jack is a nocturnal Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. He is a designer, developer, and artist for Full Moon Studios, and can be described as something of a *jack* of all trades. He enjoyed learning programming as a child because it made him feel smarter than everyone else, and he wanted to become a game developer/artist/designer ever since he got hooked on the Dragon Age series. When he isn't busying away, Jack enjoys tea, baking, and taking naps with his cat, Lucian.</p>

	<h2>Wills Martin </h2>

	<p>Wills is a man-sized puppy who also happens to be a Computer Science student at Drexel. He has been playing video games for as long as he could remember and wanted to be a programmer since he was a kid. When in  his natural habitat, Wills can be observed casually beating the rest of his team in every video game imaginable. Wills has a profound appreciation for Harry Potter, dancing, and bears.</p>

	<h2>Chris Lucas</h2>

	<p>Chris is a Game Arts and Design student and Full Moon Studios' resident insomniac. Chris loves games with a good artist direction and quality storytelling, and is known to frant about games with poor design and/or plotlines. Chris also enjoys juice, hibernating, and any furry animal that isn't a panda.</p>
