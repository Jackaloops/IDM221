	<p>Wills is a man-sized puppy who also happens to be a Computer Science student at Drexel. He has been playing video games for as long as he could remember and wanted to be a programmer since he was a kid. When in  his natural habitat, Wills can be observed casually beating the rest of his team in every video game imaginable. Wills has a profound appreciation for Harry Potter, dancing, and bears.</p>
